                    <p class="article-content">January 2, 2025 – Oil prices saw a notable increase today as investors returned from the holiday break, with a focus on China's economic recovery boosting sentiment. Brent crude and WTI crude both posted gains, driven by expectations that the Asian giant's reopening will spur demand for energy. Analysts are optimistic that China's recovery will provide a significant lift to global oil consumption, balancing concerns over supply disruptions and inflation. As oil markets remain volatile, investors are closely monitoring key economic data and geopolitical developments to gauge the trajectory of prices.
